# GrooveSeek documentation

MCP server for semantic search over a Markdown / plain-text knowledge base. The
command is `groove`.

> **日本語版**: [index.ja.md](./index.ja.md)

**Installing it, and getting a first search running, are on the front page:**
[github.com/alphabet-h/grooveseek](https://github.com/alphabet-h/grooveseek).
What follows is the reference.

Every page exists in English and Japanese, and each links to its counterpart at
the top.

## Decisions

Architecture Decision Records — what was chosen, which alternatives were
rejected, and what it cost. [ADR-0000](decisions/0000-record-decisions-as-adrs.md)
describes when a decision is recorded and when a changelog entry is enough.

ADR-0003's filename still says `kb-mcpignore`. The file it describes is now
`.grooveignore`; an ADR is not edited after it is merged, and
[ADR-0007](decisions/0007-rename-the-project-to-grooveseek.md) explains why
`kb-mcp` in anything dated before 2026-08-17 means this project.

ADR-0000 rules `.dev/` out as a home for decision records partly on the grounds
that it "has no nested repository, and is not backed up". That stopped being true
on 2026-08-10, when `.dev/` gained a private mirror. The decision stands on the
two grounds that did not change: a private mirror still does not arrive with a
clone, and public documentation still cannot link into it. The record is left as
written, for the same reason ADR-0003's filename is.
