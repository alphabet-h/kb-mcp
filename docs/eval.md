# `kb-mcp eval` — Retrieval quality evaluation

> **日本語版**: [eval.ja.md](./eval.ja.md)

## Who this is for

You only need this subcommand if you want to **compare retrieval quality across
model/config changes** or **guard against regressions when tuning**.

Regular users running `kb-mcp index` + `kb-mcp serve` **never need to touch this**.
`eval` is an independent, opt-in subcommand. Without a golden file, it does
nothing but print an error with a hint.

## What it does

Given a small file of "questions with known answers" (*golden queries*),
`kb-mcp eval` runs each question through the same hybrid search used by the
MCP `search` tool, then computes how well the returned chunks match what you
expected. On the second run onwards it diffs against the previous run, so you
can see whether a config change improved or regressed quality.

## Quick start

### 1. Write a golden file

Place it at `<kb>/.kb-mcp-eval.yml`:

```yaml
queries:
  - id: rrf-basics            # optional, used as the diff row key
    query: "What does the k parameter in RRF do?"
    expected:
      - path: "docs/ARCHITECTURE.md"
        heading: "Data flow"   # optional; omit for file-level hit
      - path: "src/db.rs"      # heading omitted → any hit in this file counts

  - query: "How are chunks deduplicated?"
    expected:
      - path: "src/indexer.rs"
```

### 2. Run

```bash
kb-mcp eval --kb-path ./knowledge-base
```

Output:

```
kb-mcp eval — 2026-04-24T14:32:01+09:00
  model: bge-m3    reranker: none    limit: 10    queries: 2

Aggregate
  recall@1   0.500
  recall@5   1.000
  recall@10  1.000
  MRR        0.750
  nDCG@10    0.821

Per-query (regressions and misses, 1 of 2)
  ✗ 32-char-truncated-query  recall@10: 0.00    expected src/indexer.rs missing
```

On the next run it will automatically show a diff against this one.

## Golden YAML reference

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `queries` | list | yes | Queries to evaluate |
| `queries[].query` | string | yes | The search query text |
| `queries[].expected` | list | yes | Ground-truth hits (at least one entry) |
| `queries[].expected[].path` | string | yes | KB-relative path, e.g. `docs/foo.md` |
| `queries[].expected[].heading` | string | no | If given, the returned chunk must match this heading (case- and whitespace-insensitive) |
| `queries[].id` | string | no | Stable identifier for diff row keys (default: first 32 chars of `query`) |
| `queries[].tags` | list | no | Reserved for future drill-down filtering |
| `defaults.limit` | int | no | Reserved; currently ignored — use CLI `--limit` |
| `defaults.rerank` | bool | no | Reserved; currently ignored — use CLI `--reranker` |

**Hit rule**: an expected entry counts as a hit if a returned chunk has the
same `path`, and (if `heading` is given) the same normalized heading
(`.trim().to_lowercase()`). No `heading` = any chunk in that file counts.

## Metrics explained

Each query has some number of *expected* hits. After running the query, we
look at the top-*k* returned chunks and compare.

### recall@k

> "Of all expected hits, what fraction appeared in the top *k*?"

Formula: `|expected ∩ top_k| / |expected|`. Range: 0.0 – 1.0.

Read this as *coverage*. `recall@10 = 0.8` means 80 % of what you expected
was in the top 10. It doesn't care about the order within top-*k*.

### MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)

> "How quickly did we find the first correct answer?"

For each query, MRR = `1 / rank` of the first expected hit (0 if none).
A value of 1.0 means "first result was correct", 0.5 means "second result
was first correct", etc. The report shows the mean across all queries.

Use this when you care more about the *top* result than the whole set.

### nDCG@k (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)

> "Are the expected hits concentrated at the top?"

Rewards expected hits that appear early in the ranking more than those near
the bottom. Normalized so 1.0 means "all expected hits at the very top"
(ideal ordering). Range: 0.0 – 1.0.

Use this to detect improvements in *ordering*, not just presence. If
`recall@10` is unchanged but `nDCG@10` improved, you moved correct answers
higher.

## Understanding the diff output

Arrows annotate the change since the previous run:

- **↑ 0.056** (green): improved by more than `regression_threshold` (default 0.05)
- **↓ 0.056** (red): regressed by more than `regression_threshold`
- **↑ / ↓ 0.010** (gray): moved, but within noise
- **—**: unchanged

The per-query section only lists queries that **regressed** or **missed**
(current `recall@max_k = 0`). For the full list, use `--format json`.

### Golden changed between runs

If you edit the golden file between runs, the fingerprints differ and the
diff is disabled:

```
⚠️ golden changed since last run, diff disabled
```

The current numbers still print. The next run will diff against this one.

## Configuration

All knobs are optional in `kb-mcp.toml`:

```toml
[eval]
golden = ".kb-mcp-eval.yml"    # default: <kb_path>/.kb-mcp-eval.yml
history_size = 10              # default: 10
k_values = [1, 5, 10]          # default: [1, 5, 10]
regression_threshold = 0.05    # default: 0.05
```

CLI flags override config values. `--golden`, `--k 1,5,10`,
`--model`, `--reranker`, `--format text|json`, `--no-history`, `--no-diff`,
`--no-color`, `--fail-on-regression`.

### `--fail-on-regression` (CI gate)

Exit with code 1 if any aggregate metric (`recall@k` for any k, `MRR`, or
`ndcg@k` for any k) regressed from the previous **compatible** run by more
than `regression_threshold` (default 0.05; tune via `[eval].regression_threshold`
in `kb-mcp.toml`). "Compatible" means the previous run had the same
fingerprint — `model`, `reranker`, `limit`, `k_values`, and the golden
YAML's content hash. Updating the golden file therefore does **not** trigger
a false regression on the next run; it just means the comparison is skipped.

History is still written before the process exits, so the new run is
recorded for the next comparison.

Typical CI shape:

```yaml
- name: kb-mcp eval gate
  run: kb-mcp eval --kb-path knowledge-base --fail-on-regression
```

The flag is a no-op when there is no previous run yet, when `--no-history`
is set, when `--no-diff` is set (since the comparison is suppressed), or
when the previous run's fingerprint differs.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `no golden file at ...` | Missing golden YAML | Create `.kb-mcp-eval.yml` or pass `--golden <path>` |
| `No index found at ...` | KB not indexed | Run `kb-mcp index --kb-path <kb>` first |
| `expected path not in index` (per-query) | The path in `expected` does not exist in the index | Check spelling / re-index |
| `golden changed since last run, diff disabled` | Golden file edited | Expected; the next run will diff normally |
| Model mismatch error | `--model` does not match the indexed model | Pass the model used for indexing, or re-index |

## Non-goals (intentional)

- **Graded relevance (0 / 1 / 2)**: parsed tolerantly but ignored today
- **Sweeps / matrices**: to compare models, run `eval` twice against two
  different indexed databases
- **Mandatory adoption**: running `eval` does not change anything about
  `index` / `serve` / `search`. It is a purely auxiliary tool
