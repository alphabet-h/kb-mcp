//! Retrieval quality gate over the committed `kb-eval` fixture corpus (BU-11).
//!
//! Until this existed, nothing in CI measured whether a change made retrieval
//! *worse*. The recall drop that feature-48 introduced was noticed only by
//! hand, on a private knowledge base, after the release. This file indexes a
//! committed 20-document Japanese/English corpus, runs the committed golden
//! query set through `groove eval`, and fails when the aggregate metrics fall
//! below a floor derived from measurement.
//!
//! # Layers
//!
//! [`kb_eval_corpus_and_golden_stay_in_sync`] needs no model and runs in the
//! ordinary `cargo test` (= the PR gate). It only checks that the corpus, the
//! manifest below, and the golden still describe the same documents — a
//! renamed fixture is caught there as a named failure instead of surfacing a
//! day later as an unexplained recall drop.
//!
//! The two `#[ignore]` tests do the actual retrieval and are picked up by
//! `nightly.yml`, which runs `cargo test -- --include-ignored` on ubuntu and
//! windows. They need no workflow change beyond the Windows skip for the
//! BGE-M3 one (~2.3 GB, same reason as the two pre-existing skips).
//!
//! # The golden has two groups, and they are averaged separately
//!
//! Twenty-five queries name one document each; five name two. **Their scores
//! are never blended.** A query with two right answers caps recall@1 at 0.5, so
//! averaging the groups together moves the headline number by an amount that
//! depends on how many multi-answer queries the golden happens to hold and not
//! at all on whether retrieval got worse. `aggregate` in the eval JSON is that
//! blend; this file computes its own means from `per_query` instead.
//!
//! # Baseline, measured 2026-08-21 (30 queries, 20 documents, 60 chunks)
//!
//! Single-answer group, 25 queries. Unchanged from the 2026-08-14 measurement,
//! which is the point: adding queries cannot move them, because the golden is
//! never copied into the corpus.
//!
//! | | recall@1 | recall@5 | MRR |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | BGE-small, as shipped | 0.92 | 0.96 | 0.940 |
//! | BGE-small, FTS leg forced silent | 0.80 | 0.88 | 0.835 |
//! | BGE-M3, as shipped | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.000 |
//! | BGE-M3, FTS leg forced silent | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.000 |
//!
//! Multi-answer group, 5 queries, two expected documents each. Three
//! deliberate breakages rather than one, because the first two moved the other
//! group and left this one where it was.
//!
//! | | recall@1 | recall@5 | MRR | nDCG@5 |
//! |---|---|---|---|---|
//! | BGE-small, as shipped | 0.50 | 0.80 | 1.000 | 0.821 |
//! | BGE-small, FTS leg forced silent | 0.20 | 0.80 | 0.567 | 0.593 |
//! | BGE-small, vector leg forced silent | 0.30 | 0.80 | 0.800 | 0.684 |
//! | BGE-small, candidate over-fetch removed | 0.40 | 0.80 | 0.900 | 0.775 |
//! | BGE-M3, as shipped | 0.50 | 1.00 | 1.000 | 0.927 |
//! | BGE-M3, FTS leg forced silent | 0.50 | 0.90 | 1.000 | 0.861 |
//! | BGE-M3, vector leg forced silent | 0.30 | 0.80 | 0.800 | 0.684 |
//! | BGE-M3, candidate over-fetch removed | 0.50 | 1.00 | 1.000 | 0.913 |
//!
//! The broken rows come from scratch builds: the full-text leg's MATCH
//! expression ([`grooveseek::db::ParsedQuery::match_expr`], named
//! `build_fts_query` when these were measured) returning `None`,
//! `search_split_candidates` returning an empty vector-leg list, and
//! `search_hybrid_candidates` asking for `limit` candidates instead of
//! `limit * 5`. The two models agree exactly with the vector leg silent, which
//! is the check that the probe silenced what it meant to.
//!
//! Six conclusions are baked into the thresholds below:
//!
//! 1. **BGE-small is the sensitive leg.** Killing the keyword half moves it by
//!    0.12 recall@1 / 0.105 MRR. Four queries degrade, three of them Japanese
//!    natural-language ones — the feature-48 class exactly.
//! 2. **BGE-M3 is blind to it at this corpus size.** Twenty semantically
//!    distinct documents are separable by the vector leg alone, so BGE-M3
//!    answers every query, keyword half or no keyword half. Its gate therefore
//!    guards the Japanese *semantic* path and catches gross regressions; it is
//!    not, and cannot be here, an FTS regression detector.
//! 3. **recall@5 is not asserted on the single-answer group.** Healthy 0.96 and
//!    FTS-dead 0.88 are only two queries apart, so any threshold loose enough
//!    to survive ordinary drift is also loose enough to sit below the broken
//!    state. It is printed in the failure report instead.
//! 4. **recall@5 is the only metric that carries information on the
//!    multi-answer group, and it is the one asserted there.** recall@1 sits at
//!    its ceiling of 0.50 on both models, and MRR is 1.000 on both, because
//!    every one of the five puts one of its two documents at rank 1 — which is
//!    exactly why these queries were needed: the metrics that gate the other
//!    group are blind to whether the *second* right answer came back at all.
//!    recall@5 separates the models 0.80 against 1.00, where on the
//!    single-answer group the same metric separates them 0.96 against 1.00.
//! 5. **BGE-small's multi recall@5 is 0.80 in every state measured**, healthy
//!    and with either retrieval leg dead. Its floor is a pin, not a detector:
//!    it records a level so that a future change dropping it is a named
//!    failure, in the way `KB_EVAL_FILES` records a file list. The metric that
//!    does move for BGE-small here is nDCG@5 (0.821 → 0.593 → 0.684 → 0.775),
//!    but every one of those breakages already fails this file's BGE-small
//!    recall@1 floor, so asserting it too would add a second way to hear about
//!    something already heard.
//! 6. **BGE-M3's multi floor is the one that can fail on its own.** A dead
//!    vector leg takes it from 1.00 to 0.80, below the 0.90 floor. In that
//!    particular run the recall@1 assertion fires first and reports it, so
//!    what the multi floor adds there is the *shape* — printed by
//!    `incomplete_report`, which names the document that left the top 5 — and
//!    not the detection. What it would catch alone is a change that costs the
//!    second right answer while leaving the first at rank 1, which is the one
//!    kind of regression the other two assertions cannot see at all.
//!
//! None of the three breakages above was needed to show the multi assertion
//! fires: raising `BGE_M3_MIN_MULTI_RECALL_AT_5` to 1.01 against the shipped
//! build does that, and the message it prints is
//! `multi-answer recall@5 1.000 < 1.010`.
//!
//! Single-answer thresholds allow **two queries of drift and trip on the
//! third**, which is the slack those scores need: RRF fusion runs on `f32`, and
//! near-ties can come apart differently on another architecture (the same
//! reason `common::mcp::extract_path_heading_order` compares paths instead of
//! scores). A real retrieval regression moves many queries at once.
//!
//! **The multi-answer floors allow one half-answer, not two.** Five queries
//! average less than twenty-five do, so the same absolute slack would put the
//! floor at 0.60 for BGE-small — under 0.50 + one half-answer, which is to say
//! under a search that returns exactly one document of every pair. Measurement
//! is what makes the tighter slack safe: this metric held at 0.80 across three
//! deliberate breakages, so it is not a number that drifts.
