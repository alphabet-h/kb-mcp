//! `groove doctor` — ask the index whether it is in the state it should be.
//!
//! Three groups of question, and one deliberate omission.
//!
//! **Integrity.** Search reads three tables that have to agree about a chunk:
//! `chunks` holds the text, `vec_chunks` the embedding, `fts_chunks` the
//! full-text row. When they stop agreeing nothing errors — a chunk missing its
//! embedding is simply never a vector hit, and one missing its FTS row is never
//! a keyword hit. `backfill_fts` exists because that has happened, and until
//! now the only way to find out was to run a full index and watch it repair
//! things.
//!
//! **Servability.** Which indexed documents the resource surface is holding
//! back, and why. This is *not* a second implementation of that rule: the
//! extension check is [`crate::indexer::paths_with_unregistered_extension`] and
//! the size check is [`crate::server::ServableRules`], the same values the
//! server answers `resources/list` from. A doctor that computed its own
//! equivalent would eventually disagree with the thing it is reporting on,
//! which is the failure mode this whole feature is about.
//!
//! **What the chunker gave up on.** Which source files were chunked by lines
//! rather than at their definitions, because one sat past the scope bound or
//! because the file wanted more chunks than one file may contribute. Those
//! files are whole and searchable — every byte reaches the index, which is what
//! [ADR-0012] requires — but their chunks carry no symbol kind, heading or
//! scope, so a query shaped like a definition cannot reach them. The parser
//! says so with a tag on the document; until now nothing read it back.
//!
//! [ADR-0012]: https://github.com/alphabet-h/grooveseek/blob/main/docs/decisions/0012-chunk-code-at-its-definitions-and-fill-the-gaps-by-line.md
//!
//! **It does not repair.** Every finding names the command that fixes it. That
//! is the contract `paths_with_unregistered_extension` already states for the
//! narrower case — report the count, suggest `groove index`, never delete —
//! and a diagnostic that mutates on your behalf is a different, larger promise.
//!
//! One thing that *is* surprising and is stated wherever it can be: opening a
//! database runs the forward migrations (see `db/schema.rs`), so `doctor` is
//! read-only about its findings but not about the file. `eval` and `search`
//! have the same property.
