//! (feature-56) Source code parsed into one chunk per definition.
//!
//! The unit is a `@definition.*` capture from the grammar's `tags.scm`, not a heading: a
//! function, a struct, a class. Everything a definition does not cover — imports, top-level
//! statements, the `impl` block's own braces, regions the parser could not understand — is
//! filled in with line-based chunks, so a file contributes every byte it has to the index.
//!
//! Why gap-filling rather than falling back to the plain-text parser when a file fails to
//! parse cleanly: [`crate::parser::TxtParser`] turns a whole file into a single chunk, which is
//! the shape this design exists to avoid. A file with a syntax error still has definitions
//! around the broken region, and those stay useful.
//!
//! The language-specific knowledge lives entirely in the grammar and its tags query. This
//! module walks the tree by field name (`name` / `type` / `trait`) and by node kind substring
//! (`comment`), both of which hold across grammars, so adding a language stays a matter of
//! supplying data rather than code.

// Deliberately not behind `grammar-rust`: which grammars are compiled in and whether groove
// can load one from disk are separate questions, and a build with no compiled-in grammar is
// exactly the build that has nothing but plugins to offer.
